Rust wrapper for Obliv-C
========================

[Obliv-C](https://github.com/samee/obliv-c) is a language for expressing Multi-Party Computation protocols as
C-like programs.
This wrapper allows to develop Rust programs that call Obliv-C protocols.

If Obliv-C is installed system-wide, that installation is used. Otherwise,
Obliv-C will be built from source.
